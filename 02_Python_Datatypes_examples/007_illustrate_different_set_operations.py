# Example 1: perform different set operations like in mathematics

# define three sets
M = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7};

# set union
print("Union of M and N is",M | N)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of M and N is",M & N)

# set difference
print("Difference of M and N is",M - N)

# set symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of M and N is",M ^ N)
